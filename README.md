Now you too can be a _gitcoin_ cryptocurrency gorillionaire.

## The git chain: an eternal golden braid ##

The copyleft patent pending _gitcoin_ technology is bitcoin for git. A _gitcoin_ miner converts precious electricity to nonsense git commits. If the first 1+(lg(commits))/4 of the commit SHA are lucky, it's a new gitcoin and the world is all the more richer.

_gitcoin_ is designed to be a naturally deflationary currency; the value of _gitcoin_ can only increase!
Therefore, all rational agents must hoard gitcoin forever.
To prevent irrational agents sabotaging the gitcoin network (cf., Byzantine economists problem), there is no way to spend/transfer gitcoins.

## Usage ##

Simply run **gitcoin.sh** from the gitcoin git repo. Once you mine gitcoin, submit a "github" "pull request" and it'll be official! It's that easy!
